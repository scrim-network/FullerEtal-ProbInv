time series for forcing

total sea level

two components -- have those

supplementary figure
    panel c is the integration
        the fit to the data is an insert

and two components


hammer2 has screen

II.  table for priors

        2) Table of model priors
        =======================
        Is there a table we have? We need to show this. Can you send me the info or even a table.

III.  likelihood function
    No I do not.  However, I know which equations from Nathan's field
    assimilation document apply.  I can consult my notes when I get back
    to Virginia and let you know which equations to use.

IV.  thesis
    chapter 1:  historical overview (10 pages or less)
        who did first SLR projections
            Danzig

        turtle breathes in/out

    chapter 3:  open questions in research (10 pages or less)

V.  Chris Marone
    A.  Klaus -- prior to Chris rejecting fall support
            1 page summary of progress
                being summarized for submission to journal, text half written, figures done
                in process of writing and wrapping up
                projected submission by end of July

                working on chapters 1 and 3

                keep it general

            Reply to All
                thanks for email and understanding...
                    work on progress report and forms
                working with Klaus to wrap up thesis
                rough timeline?
    B.  Klaus -- posterior to Chris rejecting fall support
        according to Klaus, Chris is
            1.  concerned about dept. statistics
            2.  tight monetary constraints for TA-ship
            3.  PhD good news

Done

I.  figures
        A.  pairs
        B.  There is one more figure we have but have not included yet: the fit to the paleo-data GIS.
        C.
            a. top panel is temperature forcing
                future, chain mean -- uncertainties?  5-95%
            b:  all but Greenland
            c:  Greenland, Rignot data:  95% CI, mean
            d:  everything, tide gage data:  95% CI, mean
                1.  posterior mean, and posterior credible interval

        4 panels --
            see GCM plot for layout -- ipccPlotFits() -- and hindcast/forecast arrows
            a.  as line, dots, what?

            b, c, d:  from prpanel?
            c:  rignot is plotted in figuber (this is the new way of doing a CI)

                what does prnathan do?
                    superset that does prpanel plus prnathan

            arrows not going to line up for GIS versus tide gage
                no arrows for now, observations will demarcate

        1) Figures:
        =============
        - We miss a hindcast - projection plot. Here is a suggested fix

        Figure 2: just the two left panels of the current figure 2.

        Figure 3: Full hindcast and projections, top panel T forcing, then the probabilistic hindcast and projection for GIS and non-GIS components, similar  what you did for RAND.  (shared x axis is all "similar" means)

        Figure 4: pairs, as we have

        Figure 5: current right panel of figure 2, as we have

        Figure 6: current figure 4, as we have
