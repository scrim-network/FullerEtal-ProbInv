This file contains the monthly GMSL time series as shown on figure 2 of:

Church, J. A., and N. J. White (2006), A 20th century acceleration in global 
sea-level rise, Geophys. Res. Lett., 33, L01602, doi:10.1029/2005GL024826.

The file has three columns:

Column 1: time in years (1870.0417 = Jan 1870
                         1870.1250 = Feb 1870 etc)

Column 2: GMSL in millimetres (the mean has been removed from this series)

Column 3: One-sigma error in millimetres.  This corresponds to the half-width 
          of the darker-grey band on the bottom trace of figure 2(a).  That is,
          the distance from the black GMSL line to the edge of the darker- 
          grey error band.
