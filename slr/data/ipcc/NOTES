REAL problems
    miroc
        control was garbage for hires run

    giss_aom
        drift correction does BAD things to run2

        run1 had a flat line for drift correction, BUT assimilates ok?
            0.3 versus 0.4 (emulates high)

    giss_model_e_r
        bad discontinuity in BOTH run1 and run2 between 20c3m and SRESA1B
            note that only run1 has controls for tas and zostoga

usable
    results
        grinConfigAssim(ipcc=T,ipccFile="miub_echo_g.txt",ar=0)
            0.22

        grinConfigAssim(ipcc=T,ipccFile="mri_cgcm2_3_2a.txt",ar=0)
            0.15

            mri_cgcm2_3_2a.txt mismatch?
                doesn't match models with negative feedbacks?

                fits, if "tau" and "a" parameter are allowed to be smaller

            0.3 versus 0.4 (emulates high)

            OVERPREDICTS

        grinConfigAssim(ipcc=T,ipccFile="inmcm3_0.txt",ar=0)
            0.17

lesser problems
    has considerable drift
        giss_model_e_r

        inmcm3_0

    miub_echo_g
        everything from run2--sat and zostoga--b/c 1918 is missing from run1/zostoga

        however, drift is from run1, because that is the only available

    mri_cgcm2_3_2a
        temp forcing looks like sine wave

        does weird stuff late in time

    Nathan did not like giss_aom

    has weird shape in hindcast?
        cccma_cgcm3_1:  resolution t47
            20c3m, picntrl, sresa1b, tascntrl

no problems
    cccma:  all runs match up

    mri_cgcm2_3_2a:  all runs match up

    inmcm3_0:  all runs match up

other notes
    miub_echo_g?
        may be best choice

        be concerned about _axx_ varying?
            this is okay, but t47 versus t63 is resolution
