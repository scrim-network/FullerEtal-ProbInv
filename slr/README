This is the source code for the forthcoming article on uncertainty
in decadal-scale sea-level predictions using semi-empirical models.
The code is chiefly written by Robert W. Fuller <hydrologiccycle@gmail.com>
with contributions from Nathan M. Urban, particularly in the area
of Bayesian inference.  Patrick Applegate provided guidance with
respect to the simple Greenland ice sheet model.  Klaus Keller is
serving as adviser for the project.

INSTALLING:
    1. On MacOS, install the correct Fortran compiler for R.  Determine the
       correct build number by running "gcc -v" from Terminal.app's prompt.
       If gcc is missing, download and install Apple's Xcode.
       Search for the Fortran package with the correct build number at
       http://r.research.att.com/tools/.

       Linux should already have the Fortran compiler installed.

    2. Build the shared libraries and the R packages:
        cd R
        R CMD BATCH --no-save --quiet allgrgis.R ../out/build.log
        cd ..

    3. Check the file "out/build.log" for errors.

    4. The runs will save their files in the directory "runs".  This will
       require approximately 12 GB.  If free storage on the file system
       is insufficient, then replace the "runs" directory with a symbolic
       link to a directory on another file system.  "ln -s" creates
       symbolic links on UNIX.

RUNNING:
    5. Submit the jobs (on lionxc):
        cd pbs
        ./run
        cd ..

    6. Wait for the jobs to finish.

    7. Check the files in the directory "out" for errors.

    8. Make the figures (on hammer):
        cd R
        R CMD BATCH --no-save --quiet makefig.R ../out/figures.log
        cd ..

    9. Check the file "out/figures.log" for errors.

    10. Examine the figures in the directory "figures".
