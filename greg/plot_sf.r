#
# Function that plots the survival function of a given vector of data
#
# To use this function, simply source this file:
#   source("plot_sf.r")
#
# Version History:
#   1.0 - 15 Jan 2015 - Initial coding (G.G.)
#   1.1 - 03 Feb 2015 - Added support for left.tail (G.G.)
#   1.2 - 10 Feb 2015 - Added calculation of pdf, cdf, and additional 
#                       SF information returned for plotting multiple 
#                       SFs on a single plot (K.L.R.)
#
# Note: I wrote this code because I've been asked fairly often for
# code that does this type of plot.  The original code I had included
# a lot of things the regular user wouldn't need, so I wrote a simple
# plot() wrapper to share with people.  It's not fancy, but it does the
# job.
#
# THIS CODE IS PROVIDED AS-IS WITH NO WARRANTY (NEITHER EXPLICIT
# NOR IMPLICIT).  I SHARE THIS CODE IN HOPES THAT IT IS USEFUL, 
# BUT I AM NOT LIABLE FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF THIS CODE IN YOUR OWN
# APPLICATION.  YOU ARE FREE TO SHARE THIS CODE SO LONG AS THE
# AUTHOR(S) AND VERSION HISTORY REMAIN INTACT.
#
# Function Name: plot.sf
# Parameters:
#   x - Data vector to be plotted
#   xlab - X-axis label (default = name of the data object passed
#          to the function)
#   left.tail - Should the plot highlight the left-tail instead of the 
#               right-tail? (default = F)
#   ylab - Y-axis label (default = SF  [1 - Cum. Freq.]) 
#   make.plot - Boolean value determining whether or not to make a plot
#               (default = T)
#   ... - Other parameters to be passed to the plot() function
#
# The function invisibly returns the survival function value for the
# passed data vector, even if make.plot is false.  This is useful when
# you want to customize your plot or use the survival function data
# in further analyses.
#
# See the accompanying "plot_sf_example.r" file for usage and examples.
