README file describing the data sets included here, for the calibration or
forcing of BRICK.
================================================================================

forcing_rcp26.csv   Radiative forcing file for projections, using RCP 2.6
forcing_rcp45.csv   Radiative forcing file for projections, using RCP 4.5
forcing_rcp6.csv    Radiative forcing file for projections, using RCP 6
forcing_rcp85.csv   Radiative forcing file for projections, using RCP 8.5
                    These files are used to force DOECLIM.
                    They come from the data available at

HadCRUT.4.4.0.0.annual_ns_avg_realisations (directory)
    Contains the individual ensemble members, along with the uncertainty
    estimates, which are important for calibration of DOECLIM.

future_GSL.txt    reconstructed/projected sea level rises (basically diff(SL))
future_SL.txt     reconstructed/projected sea levels (includes Church and White, 2011)
future_TA.txt     reconstructed/projected Antarctic sea-level temperatures,
                  derived from global average surface temperature anomalies
                  (if you plot against HadCRUT4 data, disturbingly good fit)
future_TO.txt     reconstructed/projected Antarctic (high-latitude) ocean
