This is a simple assimilation of the POLA tide gage data.  The model is
a*t^2 + b*t + c where t is time.  The noise is modeled as AR(1).
The assimilation was written by Robert W. Fuller.  The tide gage data
was provided by Klaus Keller.

INSTALLING:

    1. On MacOS, install the correct Fortran compiler for R.  Determine the
       correct build number by running "gcc -v" from Terminal.app's prompt.
       (If gcc is missing, download and install Apple's Xcode.)
       Search for the Fortran package with the correct build number at
       http://r.research.att.com/tools/.

       Linux should already have the Fortran compiler installed.

    2. Build the shared libraries and the R packages:
        cd R
        R CMD BATCH --no-save --quiet pola.R ../out/build.log
        cd ..

    3. Check the file "out/build.log" for errors.

RUNNING:

    4. Execute the following commands:
        cd R
        R CMD BATCH --no-save --quiet analysis.R ../out/run.log
        cd ..

    5. Check the file "out/run.log" for errors.

    6. Examine the figures in the directory "figures".

    7. The prediction chain is stored in the file "out/pred_chain.txt".

    8. The assimilation chain is in the file "out/assim_chain.txt".
