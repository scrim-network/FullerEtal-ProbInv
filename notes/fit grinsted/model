integrate model for sea level given temperature history and an initial sea level

temp
    1850-2007 from HadCRUT3v

sea level
    1850-2001 virtual station GSL reconstruction (Jevrejeva et al.)

    see page 5 as possible source of GSL reconstruction
        Grinsted et al. (2007), Jevrejeva 2008b

bias of temp/sl
    Meehl et al.?

    references to 1999
        TS, 68

    "deviation from the 1980-1999 mean"

    implemented as ar4bias function

integration
    started in 1850 (Grinsted 4)

    i started in 1870 (no sl data for 1850)

historical model parameters
    tau = 1193 (years)
    a = 3.10 (m/C)
    b = 3.68 (m)
    S0 = -0.249

model is 
    Seq = aT + b
    ds/dt = (Seq - S) / tau

    ds/dt = (aT + b - s) / tau

    is this a partial differential equation?
        it is partial b/c it has two independent variables
            S and T

    or an ODE?
        it's an ode

do we need to interpolate the temperature data?
    or can we just chose one from the interval?
        Klaus says interval is fine

can we integrate this analytically?
    Klaus says we don't do that
