deontological ethics, aka deontology -- acts are inherently good or evil, regardless of consequences;  implies following rules, such as always tell the truth;  duties are important

consequentialism -- the value of an act is judged solely by its consequences;  contrast with deontological ethics
    see rule consequentialism as well

virtue (aretaic) ethics -- character, rather than rules or consequences, determine the value of an act?  it's like being noble
