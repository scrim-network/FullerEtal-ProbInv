agent-centered theories -- duty-based

    agency -- personal moral house

    agent-relative obligations and permissions
        obligations -- what we must do

        permission -- absence of obligation -- permission to do some act even though that act will produce certain adverse consequences

    theoretically three types of agent-centered theories:  intention, causings (actions), or intended causings

    intention -- volitions or willings
        intended ends and intended means define our agency
            evil means are not moral nor are evil intentions

        belief (prediction)
            about what our actions risk

            about what our actions cause

            simply because we believe our actions might cause some evil, does not mean we intend it
                see doctrine of double effect

            simply because we intend some evil, doesn't mean our actions will cause it

    causings (actions) -- cause-based human agency
        the willing must cause the death of the innocent for an act to be a killing of such innocent

        causings of evil distinguised from omissions
            not allowed to kill, but not required to prevent death (unless we have a special relation to the victim--agency relative)

        causings distinguished from allowings
            medical unplugging is an allowing of death

            see doctrine of doing and allowing

        causings vs enablings
            enabling someone to kill is not the same as killing

        causing vs redirecting
            turn trolley to kill one instead of 5 is not causing that death

        accleration vs causing
            rescuer cutting the rope to save the rescuer when both will die is not causing the death

    intended causings -- conjoin other two
        obligation with respect to human life is neither an obligation not to kill nor an obligation not to intend to kill; rather, it is an obligation not to murder, that is, to kill in execution of an intention to kill

    criticisms -- self-centered and narcissistic with arbitrary distinctions

        gives a fourth theory, "control theory of agency"
            our agency is invoked whenever our choices could have made a difference

patient-centered theories -- rights-based (aka libertarian)
    every person has a right against being used only as means for producing good consequences without one's consent

    okay to switch the trolley b/c the patients body, labor, or talent were NOT used to save the other 4

    however, not okay to transplant from one person to the other 4

    intent is irrelevant

    killing is okay as long as it doesn't use that person without their consent?
        supplement with consequentialist-derived moral norms
            consequentialist calculus says killing is unjustifiable

        It is when killing and injuring are otherwise justifiable that the deontological constraint against usings comes into play.

problems (paradox)
    one may not violate a deontological duty even to prevent several violations by others
        bad is never justified, even when it reduces the net number of bads (anti-consequentialist)

        rely on separateness of persons to justify this
            wrongs are only wrongs to persons
                two wrongs cannot be added to create a greater wrong

            however, there is now no reason to switch the trolley

    disastrous consequences
        To take a stock example of much current discussion, suppose that unless A violates the deontological duty not to torture an innocent person (B), ten, or a thousand, or a million other innocent people will die because of a hidden nuclear device.

            threshold into consequentialism?

contractarian theories
    Morally wrong acts are, on such accounts, those acts that would be forbidden by principles that people in a suitably described social contract would accept

    orthogonal to patient-centered and agent-centered

    criticism:  social contracts favor utilitarianism which reduces this to consequentalism

Kant -- intention -- the only thing unqualifiedly good is a good will -- deontology is Kantian

advantages of deontology
    allows bias toward family, friends, projects (does not alienate or over-demand, unlike consequentalism)

    supererogatory -- can go beyond duty, unlike consequentialism which mandates maximizing good

    trolley and transplant --  more intuitive?

    justice -- people are judged rather than the overall good

lends itself to religion
