normative properties depend only on consequences

aka whether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences of that act
    OR the motive behind the act OR rules requiring the act

    is this like, "the ends justify the means?"
        or is the ends justify the means an extreme commutative example?

hedonism vs. pluralism
    hedonism -- all consequences can be divided into pleasure/desire satisfaction
        aka monism vs.
    welfare -- a superset of hedonism that includes satisfaction of desire
        BUT not pluralism
    pluralism -- beyond pleasure/desire satisfaction there are other consequences of intrinsic value;
        this can include perfectionism, which doesn't necessarily produce happy people;
        pursuit of knowledge

    pluralist consequentialism is known as un-utilitarian consequentialism

problems in consequentialism
    what is good?

    how do we measure it?

    causation
        proximity?

        proximate cause -- when voluntary acts and coincidences intervene in certain causal chains, then the results are not seen as caused by the acts further back in the chain of necessary conditions

    fairness/justice/desert
        social practices justified because they promote the overall welfare

        Thus, on the one hand, the diminishing marginal utility of material resources exerts pressure in favor of more equal distributions of resources. On the other hand, the need to promote productivity exerts pressure in favor of incentive schemes that have the foreseen consequence of material inequality. Utilitarians and most other consequentialists find themselves balancing these opposed pressures.

        prioritarianism -- additions to welfare matter more the worse off the person is whose welfare is affected
