R CMD BATCH --help                                                                                              
Usage: R CMD BATCH [options] infile [outfile]

Run R non-interactively with input from infile and place output (stdout
and stderr) to another file.  If not given, the name of the output file
is the one of the input file, with a possible '.R' extension stripped,
and '.Rout' appended.

Options:
  -h, --help            print short help message and exit
  -v, --version         print version info and exit
  --                    end processing of options

Further arguments starting with a '-' are considered as options as long
as '--' was not encountered, and are passed on to the R process, which
by default is started with '--restore --save --no-readline'.
