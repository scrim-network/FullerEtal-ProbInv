use data.frame instead of lists?
    also see I()

    as.data.frame()

    is it more efficient?  hashed?
        no, environments are hashed

    are frames passed by reference?
        no

frames are like databases, hence the name data.frame

    each column must have same number of rows

    it's kind of like a 2x2 matrix where you can vary the type

frame indexing is opposite of matrix
    column comes before row vs. matrix where row comes before column
        example:  [[col]] [row]

    unless using [[ row, col ]] in which case row comes before column
        HOWEVER, only allowed to select a single element
            in the case of [[ col(1,2) ]], behavior is recursive...  2nd element of 1st list

    another option is [ row, col ] where frame indexing behaves like a matrix
        selection of more than one element is allowed
