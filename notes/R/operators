to see the definition of an operator, it must be quoted:
    `+`

`[`(x, 2) is the same as x[2]
`+`(x, y) is the same as x+y

wtf is this ???  `[<-`
    this is the replacement operator from section 3.4.4 Subset assignment of the language reference:

             x[3:5] <- 13:15

        The result of this commands is as if the following had been executed

             `*tmp*` <- x
             x <- "[<-"(`*tmp*`, 3:5, value=13:15)

        Note that the index is first converted to a numeric index and then the elements are replaced sequentially along the numeric index, as if a for loop had been used.

how to populate an environment?
    #`$`(whoa, "foo")
    #`$<-`
    #`$<-`(whoa, "foo", 12)

    or use assign
