curve
    plot(log) calls curve()
        plot with a function name calls curve
            plot(log, xlim=c(0,5))

    curve has an add=T that works to add to an existing graph
        curve(, add=T)

    curve takes an expression in x
        curve(log(x)) is equivalent to curve(log)

    curve(x^3-3*x, -2, 2)

    Usage:
         curve(expr, from = NULL, to = NULL, n = 101, add = FALSE,
               type = "l", ylab = NULL, log = NULL, xlim = NULL, ...)

         ## S3 method for class 'function':
         plot(x, y = 0, to = 1, from = y, xlim = NULL, ...)
