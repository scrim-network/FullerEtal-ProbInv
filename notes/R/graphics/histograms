see functions density, hist, and truehist

box()
    puts box around histogram

truehist
    using
        library(MASS)
        truehist(chain[,7])

    parmaters of interest
        nbins, h, x0

density
    bw parameters
        possibilities
            "nrd"
            "ucv"
            "bcv"
            "SJ-ste"
            "SJ-dpi"

        nrd is better than default of nrd0
        ucv hung
        bcv hung

    adjust= 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.50

    foo<-density(chain[,7])
    plot(foo$x, foo$y, type="c")

    #plot(density(chain[,7]), type="c")

    lines(foo$x, foo$y)

hist
    breaks="Scott" is good  ("FD" was okay)
    probability=T is essential
    lwd=2 increases line width
