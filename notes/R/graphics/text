par("mgp") can be used to change where axis are put (for compatibility with line)

title
    writes in bold for title(main=)

    adj=0 left justify (or bottom);  left edge of axis for top

    line=0 is up against axis
    line=3 for axis labels
    line=2 goes between axis label and tick labels
    line=4 is typically outside plot

    outer=T writes in margins of device (outside mfrow/mfcol)

    title(main="foo", adj=0, line=0)

    las, crt, and srt seem to be ignored

    NO WAY TO ROTATE??

mtext
    writes in margins of plot

    at is the location along the axis
        if y-axis starts at 0, mtext("test", side=3, at=-1) writes to left of y-axis

    side=3 is top
    side=2 is left

    adj=0 left justify (or bottom);  left edge of axis for top

    las=0 parallel
    las=1 horizontal
    las=2 perpendicular
    las=3 vertical

    line works here

    font=2 gives bold
    font=3 gives italic

    example of labelling a sub-plot by letter:
        mtext("a", side=2, las=1, line=3, at=par("usr")[4], font=2)

    outer=T writes in margins of device (outside mfrow/mfcol)

par("ps") is point size
    default is 12

    expressed in 1/72's of an inch

    so point size of 12 is 1/6 of an inch tall
