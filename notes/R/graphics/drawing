abline is similar to vline (matlab), but can also do horizontal lines
    h is a horizontal line
        abline(h=0, lwd=1)

    a is slope, b is intercept
        abline(a=0, b=1, lwd=2)

    vertical line
        abline(v=assimctx$startYear, lty="dotted", lwd=1)

segments
    makes lines from pairs of points

polygon/shading regions
    makes a polygon from vertices
        must close vertices

    see Nathan's climassim() demo
        polygon(c(mod.time[1], mod.time, mod.time[length(mod.time)], rev(mod.time)), c(pred.ci[1,1], pred.ci[2,], pred.ci[2,length(mod.time)], rev(pred.ci[1,])), col=rgb(0.8,0.8,0.8), border=F)

        x values
            1st time, all times, last time, reverse of times
                top and bottom of polygon
                    there and back...
