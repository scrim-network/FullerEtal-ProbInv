note that paste has a special meaning in the context of expression( ... paste(...) ...)
    it is NOT the same as the normal paste function

expression(tau[1]==5)
    produces greek tau equals 5

creating legends:
    legends <- expression()
    legends <- append(legends, expression(tau[1]==5))

putting values into expressions
    somevar <- 5
    substitute(tau[1]==x, list(x=somevar))

as an alternative to substitute, use bquote, part in .() is taken literally
    legends <- append(legends, bquote(paste(.(rates[i]), tau[1]==.(taus[i]))))
