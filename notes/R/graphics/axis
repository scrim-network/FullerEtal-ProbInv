have plot x-scale start at limits given
    plot.window(xaxs="i")

    not sure if this works with other functions, like hist()

axTicks
    compute the tickmarks!
        (also see pretty())

lab
    A numerical vector of the form c(x, y, len) which modifies the default way that axes are annotated. The values of x and y give the (approximate) number of tickmarks on the x and y axes and len specifies the label length. The default is c(5, 5, 7). Note that this only affects the way the parameters xaxp and yaxp are set when the user coordinate system is set up, and is not consulted when axes are drawn. len is unimplemented in R.

    note that it is APPROXIMATE -- if you don't see a change, double the value

    you have to give a len, even though it is not implemented (and NA is not an option)
