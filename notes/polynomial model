Prudhome google data with tide gages

list:  POLA
    *mm versus inches
    *set random seed in code (42, 7);  refuse and tell him how

    *burn-in removal before analysis because he's a control freak
        pairs (joint pairs)

    *write out chain of million members (thinned?  wtf is he talking about)
        1.2 million and remove 200,000

        ascii file of chain
            a, b, c, rho, sigma

    send Klaus location and how to run

    *prediction chain

    *README for re-run

    please have a tick-mark with 1930 so that one can easily see this (hindcast)

    add a plot with the raw data and the imputed data for the missing values that are needed for the simple treatment of the AR(1) likelihood function. Have different symbols for the reported and the imputed

    analyze the appropriateness of the AR(1) model. (I.e., plot the PAC of (a) the detrended data using something like a loess fit similar to what I did in the matlab analysis and (b) the model residuals)

    text of the model we fit

    *projection?

    coda package in R
        convergence diagnostics

        mcmc in practice, richardson

local POLA data
    fit polynomial to that

    time dependent observation error
        AR(1) + known error

    read in local data, fits simple
        t(0) + at + bt^2
            order 2 polynomial as a function of time, 0 in 1950

        with AR(1) noise + constant observation error

            simple AR(1) model, with marginal and joint of a, b, rho, and sigma

        projection for 2100

        linearly interpolate between missing data points
