    model functions
        current model interface
            mp              fp vector
            forcings        fp matrices
            samples         int vector
            extraParms      list of various by name

        how is model function called?
            assim calls xxxModel() with mp and assimctx, unless logLik is overriden (although still called to init sp, unless optimizing likelihood instead of using SSE)
                xxxModel() grabs historical forcings from assimctx and packages parms for ode

                xxxModel calls xxx() with packaged parms

            overriden logLik() calls xxx() with packaged parms

            runPredict() calls xxx() with packaged parms
                forcings are passed into predict()

            xxxMinFn may call xxx() with packaged parms
                where assimctx is merged with genctx, could call xxxModel()

                most of these already have access to assimctx
