model -- identity problem?
    apparently not

    divide a, b, and tau by 10, same fit?

    mp <- grctx$fit$optim$bestmem
    slr <- grinsted(grctx$times, mp, grctx$method, grctx$gmst)

AR(2) complex:  split various assim methods into separate functions?
    store functions in assim$ctx?

    including noise function for predict in assim$ctx?

how to handle simple vs. complex assimilation?
    for assim
        global

        default value to assim function
            how to communicate to likelihood functions?
                extra.parms(fn, ..., envir=environment(somefnthatcallsfn))

            how to communicate to predict function?
                attribute of chain?

    class system could help?
        object system in R is primitive

    or assimctx?
        assimctx was the ticket

pdfplot.R should not automatically run graphs?
    OR should be common function that pdfplot.R equivalent calls

    pdfassim.R and pdfpredict.R

separated statistical and model parameters
    allow for case of NO statistical parameters?
        need to test indexing:  0, -0, na, etc.

        foo <- c(1,2,3)
        foo[ -(1:3) ]
        what is numeric(0)?

    other ideas:
        Nathan had the model parameters first b/c that way their dimension numbers don't change
            this has certain conveniences
                for example, could pass ALL parameters to model function
                    this may have side effects, for example, model function that simply sums parameters

        could attach indices of model parameters as attribute to an object that is passed
            see attributes

collapse pdfplot, pdfplot2, pdfplot3 and assim, assim2, assim3
    can validate changes by using same seed and comparing chains
        set.seed(1)

    function to tell if colnames contains a string -- convert to column?
        return >0 index?
            see ~/notes/linux/R/strings
