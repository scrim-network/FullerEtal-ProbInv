Kelsey has offered to help if I chose to include the Pliocene (5 million years ago) in the model assimilation.  she finds that to be a really interesting topic
right now Klaus wants me to chose among changing model structure, including the Pliocene, and finding better priors for Alexander's model subsequent to him publishing his paper
I would like to do both:  Pliocene and model structure.  I think together those two things will capture marine ice cliff instability.  I dont think either alone will solve that problem

Go with your instincts

need to include the Pliocene as data to capture MICI dynamics bc that is a period that has them.  need to include model structure to capture the dynamics in that data.  need both.  that is my instinct
data is meaningless without model structure to calibrate so that you can forecast future ice sheet evolution
