It studies the "multivariate calibration" or "inverse regression" problem, which is the statistical approach needed for paleoproxy studies.  (Given a regression between a physical quantity and a proxy during a calibration period, use new proxy measurements to infer that physical quantity at other times.  Ordinary regression is inappropriate because it reverses the relation between the dependent and independent variable.

    See Brown's text _Measurement, Regression, and Calibration_, Sec. 5.7 for the Bayesian solution.
