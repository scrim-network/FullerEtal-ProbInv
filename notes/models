how to prevent quadratic from curving up at negative temperature forcings:
    c*T + d*T*abs(T)

    c*(T-e) + d*(T-e)*abs(T-e)


Grinsted with two terms
    have more priors


modified grinsted as published by Mark Siddall


Grinsted + thermal expansion module -- doeclim
    timescale of thermal expansion


how do we get the tails right?


3 timescales
    short time scale for land glaciers
    intermed ocean
        combine short and intermediate time scale

    long scale for ice sheet
