code
    PI of y = ax+b
        a [-10, 10]
        b [-10, 10]
        future, x=1, y is uniform w/in 0.5 to 1.5
        x=1, unform prior +- 1?
        joint a & b

    beta prior--is it broken?
        no, squeezing the probabilities into a smaller space increases them (scales them up)
            so rand() effectively scales up the probabilities

    PDF of SLR 2100
        look at pola and old SLR plots
            look for PDFs

    plotting
        both kinds of marginals

    beta prior
        shape parameters?
            following Tony or paper??
                a=2, b=3

    my own prediction function that doesn't create the crazy Kelsey globals

    allow specifying expert as string

    fix Kelsey plot code to properly label Tcrit and lambda in marginal PDFs

    wire in Fortran model

    implement new assimilation with switch

    fix up window code in likelihood function

    merge Kelsey code
        set up git repo for Kelsey and separate rucker et al from my home dir

    rename files so they don't all start with dais
        what do we rename assim.R?

    function to run sample for rows from a matrix
        newfig.R and daisassim.R could benefit

        var.y change

    make model load and specification based on name and rename to rob_dais, kelsey_dais, etc.

    compare graphs

    merge Kelsey

    kelsey says no on this
       -  Vsle = 57*(1-Vais/Volo) #Takes steady state present day volume to correspond to 57m SLE
       +  Vsle = 57*(1-Vais/Vais[1]) #Takes steady state present day volume to correspond to 57m SLE

    merge Tony

    add predictions
       test graphs and compare

    run Fortran model

    update model

    fix gamma prior

    merge master branch

    try adaptive MCMC (see DOECLIM_calib_driver among others)

    update MCMC_plots.R to use new model
        need additional outputs from C model and another wrapper

        C model and R model do not output the same at 2300
            cd ~/src/dais
            Rscript kelsey_run.R
            set useCmodel <- F
            set useCmodel <- T, alex -> F

    branching with git

    code model in C and benchmark
        test Alexander's new R code
