        Tcrit is resistant to choice of prior!!!

    Tcrit vs. lambda with paleo
        do mfrow/mfcol nest?

        make plotPair do multi pair layout?
            and label them a, b, c, d, ...

    better titles
        instrumental/paleo vs expert only

    slop in y axis
        use yaxs="i"

    layout needs 100%
        need new layout() that whacks par() back to what it should be
            saves par and resets?

    take Tony's priors

    include Tony's IPCC trends

    clean up old plotting code
        # this code is broken. x[0] is NA
        #polygon(c(epdf$x, epdf$x[0]), c(epdf$y, epdf$y[0]), col="gray", border=NA)

    prob inversion works
        three inversions compared to their priors in a grid

    inferred prior probability
        Tcrit vs. Lambda -- joint & marginal for 3 different priors in 3 different colors

            http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8545035/scatterplot-with-marginal-histograms-in-ggplot2

            I like the "marginal_plot" function (at the very end - no comments on it yet) and the "ggExtra" package (close to the end). One does histograms, other does the smoothing.

            marginal_plot(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, group = Species, data = iris, bw = "nrd", lm_formula = NULL, xlab = "Sepal width", ylab = "Sepal length", pch = 15, cex = 0.5)

    add paleo and instrumental observations
        stacked

        Prob Density

        Survival function: 1-CDF

        see rand2.pdf/rand3.pdf, and maybe rand4.pdf

    is there a smoothing function for CDF in library(KernSmoothing)?
        no

    PI of y = ax+b
        a [-10, 10]
        b [-10, 10]
        future, x=1, y is uniform w/in 0.5 to 1.5
        x=1, unform prior +- 1?
        joint a & b

    beta prior--is it broken?
        no, squeezing the probabilities into a smaller space increases them (scales them up)
            so rand() effectively scales up the probabilities

    PDF of SLR 2100
        look at pola and old SLR plots
            look for PDFs

    beta prior
        shape parameters?
            following Tony or paper??
                a=2, b=3

    my own prediction function that doesn't create the crazy Kelsey globals

    allow specifying expert as string

    fix Kelsey plot code to properly label Tcrit and lambda in marginal PDFs

    wire in Fortran model

    implement new assimilation with switch

    fix up window code in likelihood function

    merge Kelsey code
        set up git repo for Kelsey and separate rucker et al from my home dir

    rename files so they don't all start with dais
        what do we rename assim.R?

    function to run sample for rows from a matrix
        newfig.R and daisassim.R could benefit

        var.y change

    make model load and specification based on name and rename to rob_dais, kelsey_dais, etc.

    compare graphs

    merge Kelsey

    kelsey says no on this

    try adaptive MCMC (see DOECLIM_calib_driver among others)

    update MCMC_plots.R to use new model
        need additional outputs from C model and another wrapper
