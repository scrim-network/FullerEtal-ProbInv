    McInnerny & Keller 2008, jump probability, proposal matrix
        this applies to uniform priors on parameters not uniform likelihood on data given model

        wide enough priors should prevent this bias from being a problem?
            the problem is things fall off the cliff near the edges, so probably

        is there a proposal matrix I should be using?
            is there code associated with the paper?

                I like the "marginal_plot" function (at the very end - no comments on it yet) and the "ggExtra" package (close to the end). One does histograms, other does the smoothing.

                marginal_plot(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, group = Species, data = iris, bw = "nrd", lm_formula = NULL, xlab = "Sepal width", ylab = "Sepal length", pch = 15, cex = 0.5)

            Tcrit is resistant to choice of prior!!!

            when flattened, not enough predictions?

not now
    implement new model structure
        hold off on this until see how model performs with Paleocene data
