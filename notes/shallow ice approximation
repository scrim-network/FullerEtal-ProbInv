shallow ice approximation

    However, it can be shown that longitudinal and
    transverse deviatoric stresses within a grounded ice
    sheet are negligible when surface slopes and ice

    thickness are averaged over horizontal distances that
    are ~8â€“20 times the ice-sheet thickness (Budd, 1968;
    Bindschadler et al., 1977). Flow of ice in a grounded
    ice sheet then only occurs in response to vertical shear
    stress, s zx (assuming steady, uniform flow, s ij us ji ;
    additionally, with our two-dimensional approxima-
    tions, s zy =0 and s *=s zx ). This results in a simplified
    momentum balance:

    such that the gravitational driving stress for ice flow is
    locally balanced by basal resistance leading to internal
    power-law creep deformation (and, as described
    below, thermally activated basal sliding for Level 3
    experiments following Eqs. (22) and (23)). This is
    known as the shallow-ice approximation (SIA; Hutter,
    1983).

    Under the assumption of the shallow-ice approxima-
    tion (Hutter, 1983), the full momentum balance is
    simplifed such that the gravitational driving stress for
    ice flow is locally balanced by basal resistance leading to
    internal power-law-creep deformation and, under linked
    surface-melt/lubricated-bed and/or thawed-bed condi-
    tions, to basal motion (see Section 2.2.2). Horizontal
    mass flux is vertically integrated. Transverse flow
    divergence is parameterized to minimize the discrepancy
    between observed and 2D modelled ice volumes on a
    domain that includes divergent flow off a dome (e.g.
    Whillans and Cassidy, 1983; Greve and MacAyeal,
    1996; Pattyn, 2000; cf. Parizek, 2000; Parizek et al.,
    unpublished). Continuity results in the following diffu-
    sion equation:
