5. Two-term Grinsted, two sea levels
Two Grinsted-style terms, completely uncoupled, describing separate relaxation of GIS
and non-GIS sea levels to their own equilibria.
dS/dt= dS1 /dt + dS2 /dt

dS1 /dt=(Seq,1 - S1 )/Tau1
dS2 /dt=(Seq,2 - S2 )/Tau2
Seq,1=a1 T + b1
Seq,2=a2 T + b2

PROS: Explicit transient GIS. CONS: Equilibrium sea level for GIS can exceed avail-
able GIS mass (~7 m SLR equivalent). Estimated parameter values may not be sen-
sible. No real GIS dynamics. No GIS mass upper bound.


Recommendations

Option 5 (two-term Grinsted, two sea levels) is probably the best for immediate imple-
mentation. Option 6 (Grinsted + conceptual GIS) could be preferable if an appropriate
model can be obtained/implemented within the desired time constraints. (Such a model
would need to have a plausible parameterization of deeply uncertain basal mechanics.) Op-
tion 9 is likely best if lots of implementation time is available.
All options will have to confront several challenges: (1) GIS acts on multiple time scales,
so millennial paleo constraints may not give parameter estimates appropriate for centennial
projections. (2) Observational constraints are sparse. (3) Following (1) and (2), the results
may be completely prior-dominated. If so, is this any better than expert elicitation of SLR
projections?



All,

Rob and I met with Richard Alley today.  It helped a lot.  We should
have consulted him earlier.

He said that for our purposes (simple centennial-scale GIS mass loss
projections), he'd be perfectly happy to use Grinsted's basic model.

I think that settles the question of what to use for Rob's paper: a
variant of model 5, two-term Grinsted with two sea levels.  If it
passes Richard Alley's laugh test, it's fine by me.  For future
integrated-assessment work, we can still consider something more
mechanistic.

Richard did say that we should modify the Seq vs. T curve from
Grinsted's linear form, and said we should instead use the estimates
from the CCSP SAP report which Klaus previously suggested.

That CCSP figure puzzled me before because it doesn't seem to
asymptotically approach Greenland's total sea-level equivalent as
temperature increases, or approach any value.  I expected it to act
more like Siddall's arcsinh or something, with downward curvature and
a horizontal asymptote.  Rather, it keeps increasing at an
accelerating pace (curving upward at a super-linear rate like a
parabola does).

Richard explained that we should treat it as positively curved until
it hits the GIS mass limit, and then constant afterward -- e.g., as a
piecewise quadratic-constant function, with a "kink"
(non-differentiable) at the changepoint.  They just didn't bother to
plot the constant part.

We also tried to elicit an e-folding response time.  Richard just said
"a couple thousand years", to within a factor of "2 or 3".  I'm
thinking we should treat this as a lognormal prior centered on maybe
1500 years, extending from 500 to 4500 years.  He said there are
actually multiple response times corresponding to different processes,
but the one we care about for centennial projections is closer to 1000
than 10,000.

Richard also said we could try to nail down this number better by
fitting our model to some of Byron's step-forced model runs.  Byron's
model has key lake-drainage effects which Richard thinks will be
strong controls on the relevant response time.  To begin with
we can just start with Richard's guess, and talk to Byron about
how hard it would be to get some model results.
